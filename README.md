# ProgrammerStepByStep
  I was wondered how to be a professional programmer. After years of coding using different programming languages,
I decide to write a tutorial for myself, recording the path i find out to be the best for me,  and for someone who
wants to be a professional programmer.
  The first stuff is learning basic information about how to use github for recording the tutorial.

Step 1:
  pass through https://guides.github.com/ to get basic ability to record the tutorial on my GitHub.
