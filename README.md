# ProgrammerStepByStep
  I was wondered how to be a professional programmer. After years of coding using different programming languages,
I decide to write a tutorial for myself, recording the path i find out to be the best for me,  and for someone who
wants to be a professional programmer.
  The first stuff is learning basic information about how to use github for recording the tutorial.

Step 1:
  pass through [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/) to get basic ability to record the tutorial on my GitHub.
Step 2:
  [Gnu Related Tutorial](https://github.com/itm94lj/ProgrammerStepByStep/blob/main/GnuTutorial.md) offers basic gnu related software, basic skills of these software are needed.
